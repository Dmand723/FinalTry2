## Features

## Developer Roadmap 

the main premise of the game is that you worked with a scientist working on inter-dimensional travel with gems that creates portals, you found it was too hard to open the portals to other dimensions from your lab so you went to other places and found an island that the barrier between other dimensions was weaker making it easier to open the portals and made a portal linking the island to your lab that used a different gem. after discovering the island that made it easier to travel between other dimensions you and your partner were very excited and stated working on a way to show it to the world but without you knowing your partner made a plan to trap you in the other dimension to get rid of you and planed to wait until you die so he can have all the glory for himself but as he was scared that you might try this too he hid 3 parts of an extra gem across 3 dimensions to get home and made them only accessible behind puzzles that he created to try and secure them more, along with that he hid the gems needed to go to those dimensions around the dimension you got trapped in. The objective of this game is to go to the 3 dimensions and complete the puzzles to make your way back home before you die without food.


to make the game simpler to create in the timeframe for class only focus on core game mechanics and steps marked with (*)

    make a quick cutscene with text explaining how you got trapped here 

Game timer 

    create a timer of time before you die that you have to complete the game before it runs out


Portal and gem animations 

    make the gem you place down float up and glow to create the portal and keep it open/ stable
    Make the portal assemble the pieces of the portal frame from the gem and create the portal with it’s respective color in the center

Inventory system

    have an array of game objects of the items you have that correspond to hotbar slots
